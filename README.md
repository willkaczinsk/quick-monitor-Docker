# Welcome to cli-hub! ðŸ‘‹

At cli-hub, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern tech stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with simple backend framework for small projects, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

* **[qa](https://github.com/cli-hub/qa)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast qa library. âœ¨

Beyond qa, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas:

* api_routes.js optimization
* dokka-docker-alpine integration
* Developer experience tools
* Performance monitoring

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline development.
